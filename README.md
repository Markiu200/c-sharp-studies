# What's this?
Here I learn C#. And getting used to Git / GitHub. That's it.

* **start01** is me following (more or less) __[*C# Basics for Beginners: Learn C# Fundamentals by Coding*](https://www.udemy.com/course/csharp-tutorial-for-beginners/)__ by Mosh Hamedani on Udemy.
* **start01_6-0** is the same, but abandonded at the beginning. At some point I wanted to show my "program" to Leme, but it didn't work properly. Leme was missing .NET 8.0, so I rewrote it to work as .NET 6.0, and it worked.<br>
I keep working with .NET 8.0 from now on, I am aware of potential problems related to this, and for now it's good enough for me.
* **intermediate** is me following (more or less) __[*C# Intermediate: Classes, Interfaces and OOP*](https://www.udemy.com/course/csharp-intermediate-classes-interfaces-and-oop/)__ by Mosh Hamedani on Udemy.
